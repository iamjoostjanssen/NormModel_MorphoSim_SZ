Docker and modelling
This is very similar to Singularity. Assuming you have Docker installed you just need to pull and run a pre-build Docker image from dockerhub:
docker run -v  /$path_to_input_dir/:/mnt/data -h master --privileged -it joostmadrid/normmodel_pcnv21:0.1 bash
Example command from inside docker
/opt/conda/bin/python normative_modelling_madrid_31.py -c /mnt/data/train_covars.txt -d /mnt/data/train_features.txt -t /mnt/data/test_covars.txt -r /mnt/data/test_features.txt -o /mnt/data/ -w 'WarpSinArcsinh' -s age sex -a blr -q yes
Code parameters 
-c: train covariates file path
-d: train responses file path
-t: test covariates file path, default=None
-r: test responses file path, default=None
-o: output directory where data will be saved
-w: warp function, default=None, options: 'WarpSinArcsinh', ‘WarpAffine’ or None
-s: name of covariables (all of them that are not scanners/sites), default=age sex 
-k: cross-validation folds (integer number), default=None
-a: algorithm, default=blr, options: blr or gpr
-n: number of knots bspline (integer number), default=5
-p: order of spline (integer number), default=3
-z: optimizer to estimate the model, default=powell, options: powell, l-bfgs-b
-x: covariable to plot in x-axis, default=age
-q: display qq-plots, default=None, options: yes, true… or None
-v: train covariates file path used for heteroskedasticity (without column names), default=None
-b: test covariates file path used for heteroskedasticity (without column names), default=None
-e: adaptation covariates file path, default=None
-f: adaptation responses file path, default=None
(Note: default values mean that if the parameter is not specified by the user, the default value will be used if needed. For instance, if the user does not provide the number of knots, the default value 5 will be used. However, if for instance the user provides test data and doesn’t specify the number of cross-validation folds because it does not make sense, it won’t use the cv-folds parameter even if there is a default value for cv-folds.)


Input files format
In both covariates and responses files each row is a subject.
Covariates files: 
* columns: age and sex must be present. Scanners/sites must be binary variables (can be present or not). Other covariates can be present such as euler, total volume…
Response files: 
* columns: each column is a feature.


Note
1. Gaussian Process Regression is not compatible with: warping and transfer learning.
2. Test data is being plotted for the visualization of the model, and consequently used to calculate qq-plots (both traditional and counting plots). If the visualization of training data is desired, choose the training data as if it were the test data.
