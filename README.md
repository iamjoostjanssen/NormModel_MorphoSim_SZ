# NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ


Normative modelling of Morphometric Similarity in health and Schizophrenia

This repository contains information pertaining to the study Reference Modelling of Morphometric Similarity in health and schizophrenia (Janssen et al. 2024).

We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. Instructions for installing and running the docker for reference modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt).

A list of study IDs from included subjects can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Included_subjects_IDs.csv).
