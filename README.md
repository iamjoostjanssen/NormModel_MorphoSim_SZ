# NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ


This repository contains information pertaining to the study Normative Modelling of Morphometric Similarity in Health and Schizophrenia (Janssen et al. 2024).

We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt).
A list of study IDs from included subjects can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Included_subjects_IDs.csv) and their 5 features for calculating morphometric similarity can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/RefModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Included_subjects_5_features_10_publicdatasets.csv). The normative modeling plots with percentile curves and Q-Q plots for all regions of the Desikan-Killany-Tourneville (DKT) atlas can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/tree/main/NormativeModels) and [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/tree/main/Q-Q%20plots), respectively. The overlap between the DKT atlas and the 7 functional networks from Yeo et al. (2011), based on [Váša et al. (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5903415/), can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/yeo_dkt_overlap.csv) and the overlap between the DKT atlas and the 5 classes from the von Economo-Koskinas atlas (von Economo and Koskinas, 1925, [Scholtens et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28040542/)) can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/voneconomo_dkt_overlap.csv). Distributions of morphometric similarity and corresponding Z-scores for each region and network can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/tree/main/Distributions). The figures containing cortical surface renderings were made using [fsbrain](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain.html).
