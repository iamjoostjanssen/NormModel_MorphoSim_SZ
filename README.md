# NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ


This repository contains information pertaining to the study Normative Modelling of Morphometric Similarity in health and schizophrenia (Janssen et al. 2024).

We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. Instructions for installing and running the docker for reference modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/Normodel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt).

A list of study IDs from included subjects can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Included_subjects_IDs.csv) and their 5 features for calculating morphometric similarity can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/RefModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Included_subjects_5_features_10_publicdatasets.csv). The centile and quantile-quantile plots for all regions of the DKT-atlas can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/tree/main/NormativeModels) and [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/tree/main/Q-Q%20plots).
